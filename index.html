      <h1>HORROR & Stuff</h1></header>
      <p><b>One of my favorite things is watching horror films, I love all kinds. So here is an extremly short history on the genre. The horror genre has ancient origins, with roots in folklore and religious traditions focusing on death, the afterlife, evil,the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These manifested in stories of beings such as demons, witches, vampires, werewolves and ghosts. The first ever horror movie was called 'Le Manoir du Diable' in 1896 a.k.a The hose of the Devil" it was only 3 minutes long. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction#19th_century"> Wikipedia the most reliable Reference</a> </b></p>

         <h2 style="font-size: 35px"><u>Why we love to watch them!</u></h2>
         <p><b>One reason we consume horror is to experience stimulation. Exposure to terrifying acts, or even the anticipation of those acts, can stimulate us — both mentally and physically — in opposing ways: negatively (in the form of fear or anxiety) or positively (in the form of excitement or joy). For instance, watching a horror video simultaneously activates both types of stimulation, with the most pleasure experienced at the most fearful moment. The biochemical inside our bodies also changes when we consume horror. Fright can trigger the release of adrenaline, resulting in heightened sensations and surging energy. <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/10/the-psychology-behind-why-we-love-or-hate-horror#:~:text=One%20reason%20we%20consume%20horror,form%20of%20excitement%20or%20joy).">Someone in Harvard said it, so it must be true!</a></b></p>
